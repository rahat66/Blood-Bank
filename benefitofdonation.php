        <ul>
           <li>Health reduced risk of hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is a health condition that arises due to excess absorption of iron by the body. This may be inherited or may be caused due to alcoholism, anemia or other disorders. Regular blood donation may help in reducing iron overload. Make sure that the donor meets the standard blood donation eligibility criteria</li>
            <li>Blood donation helps in lowering the risk of cancer. By donating blood the iron stores in the body are maintained at healthy levels. A reduction in the iron level in the body is linked with low cancer risk.</li>
            <li>Blood donation is beneficial in reducing the risk of heart and liver ailments caused by the iron overload in the body. Intake of iron-rich diet may increase the iron levels in the body, and since only limited proportions can be absorbed, excess iron gets stored in heart, liver, and pancreas. This, in turn, increases the risk of cirrhosis, liver failure, damage to the pancreas, and heart abnormalities like irregular heart rhythms. Blood donation helps in maintaining the iron levels and reduces the risk of various health ailments</li>
            <li>Regular blood donation reduces the weight of the donors. This is helpful for those who are obese and are at a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases and other health disorders. However, blood donation should not be very frequent and you may consult your doctor before donating blood to avoid any health issues.</li>
            <li>After donating blood, the body works to replenish the blood loss. This stimulates the production of new blood cells and, in turn, helps in maintaining good health.</li>
            <li>In addition to all of these benefits, a donor receives a free prior health screening plus mini blood test. There will be an HB level test, as well as a blood pressure and body check. Blood is also tested for some major diseases and the donor is immediately informed in strict confidentiality if any of these tests show positive results.</li>
            <li>Male contain 76ml Blood/Kg. 50ml blood is needed for body circulation. Extra 26 ml/Kg remains in the body. Let’s consider a male of 50kg. He contains 50*26= 1300ml extra blood. In case of female they contain 66ml Blood/Kg. Only 50ml blood is needed for body circulation. Extra 16 ml/Kg remains in the body. Let’s consider a female of 50kg. She contains 50*16= 900ml extra blood. But for donation 450 ml blood is required from this extra blood. </li>
            <li>By donating blood, many lives are saved and hope is given to many whose situation may otherwise be hopeless. Blood donors give such patients a second lease of life.</li>
            <li>When you donate blood, you impact not only the patient whose life may depend on your donation, but also all those who depend on that patient. The entire community will benefit from the spirit of generosity.</li>
